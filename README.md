# Thesis  
  
This repository was made for my thesis. 


It contains the followings:  
-all the trained model's codes as .ipynb, these can be executed in Google Colab  
-all the trained and optimized weights  
-all the support scripts and codes  

The datasets are freely available to anyone.  

With these every training can be reproduced  
Important to note, when the codes refer to uploading/copying from the user's Google Drive, then the instructions are meant the above listed ones.
